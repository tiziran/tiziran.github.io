- When to Use ML and Course Vision
	- Intro
		- more ML product
		- commoditization of model training 
		- translation research to real-world products
		- ML production engineering
		- [[MLOps]]
	- When to use machine learning
		- lots of ML projects fail 
			- ML is still research
			- technically infeasible or poorly scoped
			- unclear success criteria
			- #paper: ML: The high-interest credit card of technical debt
		- #book: The economics of AI

	- How to pick problems to solve with ML 
		- TL/DR: high impact, low-cost
	- Life-cycle of a ML project
		- planning & project setup
		- data collection & labeling
		- training & debugging
		- deploying & testing
