steps
	parts detection
	resize with keep aspects ratio
	ML
		perform detection
		semantic segmentation
	transfer to original coordinate

challenges
	class imbalance
	class definition 
		use class in between 
	inconstant annotations

color augmentation
	RGB shift
	random brightness and contrast
	sharpen
	hue, saturation, value

Why manually data augmentation?
because we want to control of data augmentation. for example change rotation angle to just few or change color only in one range
